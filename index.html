                Suppose you were put in charge of operations at a major bank.
                How would you manage it?
                Well, a bank is not just one big program like your CS32 project.
                If you manage it, you manage hundreds of different services,
                running on thousands of separate machines, maybe running in another company's cloud.
                How would you know if it was working or broken? Or just slow?
                How would you know if your users were having a good experience?
                </br>

                I'm Matt Cannizzaro, this is Evan Fuller. We work at AppDynamics,
                and we help people run really big and complicated applications.

                We're going to spend most of this talk on technical stuff,
                but I just want to give you a little more context about our company first.

                Say you're building a web app. It might start small, but
                hopefully it will need to grow. You can get bigger and bigger

                (https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/airbnb/)

                From this screenshot from AWS Re-Invent 2013, you can see the myriad of services
                that Airbnb deploys throughout their tech stack. They deploy EC2 instances for serving content,
                multiple types of storage (SQL and NoSQL), and object storage. As of 2013, they deployed over 1,000
                EC2 instances for serving web content, and 50 TB worth of photos in S3.
 
                Nathan Blecharczyk:
                "pretty much any time we can use an AWS instance to solve a problem, we will, so that we don't have to solve that problem ourselves"

                It is clear that over the past several years, an increasing number of companies have shifted their
                perspectives to rely on collections of external web services from AWS. The increasingly complicated
                topology of an application is what necessitates AppDynamics.

                As one last example of an application's topology, examine MLB's Player Tracking System. This system
                collects data tracking the position of the ball and players every game of the season, which in
                aggregate represents 7 TB per game, or 17 PB per season. The system is implemented across so many
                components in order to handle many use cases: for example, ElastiCache is used for caching large
                chunks of data in memory while performing compute-heavy analysis tasks.

                Keep in mind, the screenshot on this slide only shows the topology for the set of use cases I've just
                gone over here. Every other project managed by MLB Advanced Media likely has similarly complex systems.

            <aside class="notes">
                There's a certain satisfaction in writing efficient, fast code.
                But fundamentally, why do you need to care about performance?
                Making good use of the infrastructure and resources that you
                have is important, but it's not (usually) the most important thing.
                Your app exists to solve your users' problems, but users are
                impatient: if your app is slow, users will abandon it. This
                problem is particularly bad if users have many alternatives
                and the cost of switching is low. Think about booking a flight
                on a travel site. If one site is slow, it's really easy to
                try one of its competitors instead. If your app is a business,
                bad performance costs money.

                Highlights from the Akamai report included here indicate that
                users expect the apps they are using to be responsive on the
                resolution of a few seconds.

            <h3>How you can measure performance?</h3>
            <aside class="notes">
                Once you realize that you care about performance, you'll want
                to understand how your app performs by measuring it. How
                might you go about doing that? It would be reasonable to
                start by collecting some data from each node your app is
                running on, like CPU and memory utilization, how often
                garbage collections are running, and things like that. This
                is better than nothing, but not by much. Users don't care
                about any of these things: they care about their experiences.
                It's almost certainly bad if 5% of your users have a poor
                experience with your app. Imagine if Google dropped one out of
                every twenty searches that you ran! But could you detect
                such a problem by looking at, say, CPU utilization? You'll
                need a deeper understanding before you can find and fix many
                types of problems.

            <aside class="notes">
                Traditionally, applications were deployed only a few times a
                year, and each deployment was a major event. The rise of the
                web and distributed applications has made it much easier to
                deploy more often, so it's not uncommon for developers to
                deploy new versions of their web apps multiple times in a
                single week. This is great news for users, who benefit from 
                new features and bug fixes, but it introduces new problems
                for performance monitoring. Since your app is constantly
                changing, your performance monitor needs to be able to
                quickly adapt to the new environment. A tool that requires
                lengthy or complex configuration slows you down and is not
                suitable for modern web application development.

                To recap, we need our performance monitor to be: <br/>
                    1. Distributed, because your app is. <br/>
                    2. Monitor your application performance, not the
                        infrastructure, because your users experience the app.
                        <br/>
                    3. Dynamically adapt to changes in your environment,
                        because you don't have time for configuration.

            <h2>Telling the story of a request</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                We suspect that infrastructure monitoring is not enough, so
                how will we measure performance? Your users interact with
                your app over HTTP, so that's a logical place to start. If
                we know when a request arrives at your server, and when your
                server finishes sending the response, that's a decent
                measure your app's performance from the user's perspective.
                <br/>
                You know when requests arrive and when the corresponding
                responses are sent, so you can identify which requests are
                slow, or fail outright. This helps you know when your app
                is having problems, but it doesn't help you in figuring out
                why. How can we do that?
                <br/>
                Remember that your app is distributed, so before your app
                can respond to the user's request, it probably needs to make
                some requests of its own to various parts of your backend,
                receive and process the responses, and then generate the
                response that your user sees. Let's assume that all this
                communication happens over HTTP. Can we tie all these related
                HTTP requests and responses together, so that you can tell
                the full story of a single user request? What if we could
                somehow tag related requests with some identifying
                information?

                Here's an example of an HTTP request. It has these interesting
                components: <br/>
                1. The HTTP method, like GET or PUT. <br/>
                2. The URI, which along with the method, helps you determine
                    what the user is requesting. <br/>
                3. The headers, which are essentially a list of key-value
                    pairs. <br/> 
                4. The request body, which is optional and could contain
                    arbitrary data. <br/> <br/>

                If we want to add some data to an HTTP request, headers are
                attractive, since we can easily add a header with some
                identifying information without changing the behavior of the
                rest of the application.

                When a request from a user first arrives, start by generating
                a unique ID for it. At some point, the routine that is
                processing the user's request may make some requests to other
                nodes in your application. When this happens, add the unique
                ID as a header in the request. Using this method, we can
                discover every HTTP request and response that's involved in
                servicing a user's request, and if the user's request is
                slow, or encounters an error, we can determine where the
                problem lies.<br/><br/>
                Of course, out in the wild, you'll often find protocols other
                than HTTP being used in the backend. The same sort of
                principles apply for other protocols, but we won't get into
                the details today.

                makes HTTP requests that passes these identifiers between
                requests. It would be fairly straightforward, but tedious
                and error-prone. Worst of all, it makes it hard to add new
                code and nearly impossible to integrate a third party library.

                For argument's sake, let's assume that your app is written
                in Java. It starts out as source code, which the Java compiler
                transforms into Java byte code during compilation. When it's
                time to run your program, you can't just run the byte code
                as is; your CPU doesn't understand byte code. So the Java
                Virtual Machine does another transformation, this time turning
                the byte code into native machine code. You'll recall that this
                step is called just-in-time compilation, or JITing.<br/><br/>
                
                Usually each step of this process preserves the behavior of
                your code, but you certainly could imagine a transformation
                that doesn't. A compiler or JIT that performed such a
                transformation would be considered buggy, but if you were
                careful, you could transform code in a way that 
                changes its behavior in a useful way while not interfering
                with the purpose of the program.<br/><br/>

                In theory, you could do your code transformation on either
                the source code, the byte code, or the machine code. Changing
                the source code would be a nightmare for the app developers,
                and doing machine code transformations would require altering
                the JVM and result in an implementation that's dependent
                on CPU architecture, so neither is particularly interesting.
                Java byte code, on the other hand, can be altered transparently,
                as far as developers are concerned, and by definition, is
                independent of any specific CPU architecture.

                Let's say that the method that implements HTTP requests in
                your app looks something like this. Since few apps
                re-implement this functionality from scratch, this method
                is probably part of a library. In order to instrument it,
                we need to transform the body of the method from this, into...

                ... this. We can use a technique called byte code injection
                to perform this transformation at runtime. Here's how it works:
                when the JVM is running a program and it needs to find the
                definition of a class, it uses a special sort of object
                called a class loader. The JVM provides an API to hook into
                the class loading process so that your code is called after
                a class loader has found the definition of a class, but
                before that class's definition is available to the rest of
                the program. We use this opportunity to examine 
                the class being loaded, and if it happens to be a class that
                we are interested in instrumenting, we write new byte code
                into the bodies of its methods. <br/> <br/>

                Now that we are running instrumentation code at the beginning
                and end of each interesting method, we can keep track of how
                long each HTTP request takes, and write identifying information
                into the request headers as well. This is all we need to
                implement the tag and follow scheme for instrumenting HTTP.
                <br/> <br/>

                This technique is fundamentally straightforward, but since
                our instrumentation code runs within the program being
                monitored, this part of our system, called the agent, needs
                to be thoughtfully engineered and tested. If the agent is
                buggy, it's very possible for it to bring an application down,
                which obviously defeats the whole purpose. Since the agents
                monitor apps in production, they also need to keep overhead
                to a minimum: we generally promise our customers no more than
                2% overhead on average. AppDynamics has agents for Java,
                .NET, PHP, Javascript, node.js, Android, iOS, and more.
                These agents work in different ways, but the goals and
                principles are similar.

            <h1>Making sense of the data</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
                In a production environment, there are many agents reporting
                quite a large amount of data. This means that we need to have
                a scalable way of collecting and aggregating all this data,
                and also need to have effective visualizations to help
                our users make sense of it. Let me show you our product and
                demo some of the basic features.

                Besides telling you about AppDynamics, Evan and I thought
                it would be nice to give you something more generally useful.

                We thought we could give you some unsolicited advice for your
                first year after college.

                You might be thinking "why the hell should I listen to this guy?
                He's just some alum from years ago recruiting for some random company!"

                Which is totally reasonable. I don't expect you to just take my word
                on this stuff. Instead, listen to my arguments and see if you're convinced.

                And I welcome discussion during this part, so please interrupt me

            <h2>1) Do code reviews</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                Getting your code reviewed makes you a better programmer, for the same reason that
                getting your essays graded makes you a better writer. This one is pretty simple.

                But there's also a huge benefit for the reviewer. Who here is or has been an
                undergrad TA or head TA? Remember how much better you learned the material
                when you TA'ed the class than whan you took it originally? Reviewing code is like that.
                It makes you engage with the material on a deeper level. It expands your perspective
                and forces you to re-examine your beliefs about what good code is.<br/>

                When you interview, ask about code reviews. It's very diagnostic. A culture that does code reviews
                is a culture that values quality and craftsmanship. That's the kind of place where you're really going
                to learn.<br/>

            <h2>2) Learn tech that transfers</h2>
            <p>Not proprietary stacks.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                I used to work at Adobe, and one of the reasons I left is that I had become an expert on Flash, which is
                a dead technology. When I applied to my next job, I basically had to apologize for that.
                So one obvious tip is: don't waste time on dead technology.<br/>

                But there's a subtler issue too, which is proprietary technology - technology that is owned and
                maintained only by one group of people. All the reasons that people don't like to USE proprietary
                technology apply at least twofold when it comes to LEARNING proprietary technology. Proprietary
                knowledge is by definition not useful outside of a very small context.
                That means it has virtually no value when you look for your second job.
                I know you're all focused on your first job right now, but you should always keep in mind how your first
                job is going to prepare you for your second job.<br/>

                Now, you might think "isn't it more important that I learn transferable skills, ideas, and principles?"
                Yes, of course that's more important. But when you only know Adobe- or Google- or Facebook-specific
                libraries, you are a little bit boxed in. If you know all the industry-standards, on the other hand,
                you're like a code McGuyver: when you non-technical friend comes along with some startup idea,
                you can just make it happen.<br/>

                I have to say that it's pretty hard to avoid proprietary knowledge at a big company.
                At most big companies, you will be surrounded by layers of proprietary software in every direction.
                Small companies just haven't been around long enough to accumulate that. They also don't have the
                luxury to indulge in "not invented here" syndrome.<br/>

                I also need to make a plug for AppDynamics specifically. Facebook has this amazing VM for running
                PHP code super fast. If you work at Facebook, you can learn how that works. If you work at Google,
                you can learn how about Google's insanely scalable database works. But if you work at AppDynamics,
                you can learn about how TiVo works, how Nasdaq works, how Expedia works, how Okta works.
                Because our job is to undestand, and help our customers understand, how these big apps really work.
                It doesn't get much more generally-applicable than that!<br/>

            <h2>3) Get real feedback</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                The first product I worked on at Adobe was really cool. We talked to potential customers and they
                thought it was cool. We worked hard on it for 3 years and shipped it.
                Then we found out there was no real market for it because it didn't <i>really</i> fit into
                anyone's workflow.<br/>

                The "potential customers" didn't mention that part. It's really easy to say "that's so cool, I would
                totally use that!" It's a totally different thing to actually break your habits and change your
                workflow.<br/>

                On my product at AppDynamics, we did it right. We shipped a working version (with a limited feature set)
                three months after we started the project. And people <i>actually</i>
                started using it. They filed bugs! They made feature requests. And we added the things they wanted.
                And we got more users. And it was glorious.<br/>

                I had an interesting experience at AppDynamics that expanded my perspective again. Shortly after
                we shipped my product, my team was in a meeting with the founders and the VP of engineering,
                deciding what to work on next. There were two broad possibilities: features that would make the product
                more useful (since it was fairly limited), and features that would allow us to charge people to
                use the product. I said "I think we should focus on making the product useful before worrying about
                charging for it. Once we have something we know is valuable, then we can charge for it." Jyoti, our founder
                (who is also an engineer), replied "How will we know if it's valuable if nobody is paying for it?"<br/>

                At first that struck me as just really really...capitalistic. But as I thought about it, I realized
                he had a point: people who are using a free product will not necessarily give you the feedback you need
                to make a product somebody is willing to pay for.<br/>

                Now, I'm not saying this is the only way to do it. What I am saying is that if you want customer
                feedback to help guide your decisions, you need to think hard about how to get the right feedback.<br/>

            <h2>4) Stay close to the business</h2>
            <p>Sorry, this means money.</p>
            <p>Full-stack visibility.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                When I looked for my first job, I thought "I want to work on hard problems with smart people, and maybe
                do something that improves the world". And most of my friends had the same criteria. It's very tempting
                to not worry too much about the business. But there are some business considerations that can have a
                material impact on your career.<br/>

                First, a very harsh reality: if you're not working on something that generates revenue, your project
                is expendable. It doesn't matter what your manager says. It doesn't matter if the CTO is coming around
                your desk every week to check on the status. If it doesn't solve some real problems for some real people
                who know they have these problems and are willing to pay you to solve them, it is a ship adrift on the
                fickle seas of corporate strategy. Maybe the CTO gets pushed out of the company for some reason, and the
                new CTO doesn't understand the value of your product. Maybe the CEO can't figure out how to justify
                the cost on the quarterly earnings call. There are a thousand ways for a product to die. But if it's
                solving real problems for real customers and making money...it has much better chances.<br/>

                Second: it's really valuable talk to non-engineers on a regular basis.
                If you don't talk to the sales team, you really don't know anything about your business.
                The same goes for operations, customer support, and marketing.
                This will make you better at your job. It will make you more valuable to the company.
                You will learn a lot. And if you think you might want to start your own company some day,
                you'll have a huge advantage because you'll know how a business really works.
                Note that this is really hard to do in a big company.<br/>

                Both of these are also much easier to do in small companies. Most small companies don't have the luxury
                of working on non-business-critical things for any length of time. And in a small company, you'll be
                surrounded by non-engineers simply because there aren't enough engineers to buffer you from them.<br/>

            <h2>5) Beware of tech debt</h2>
            <p>Your code lives longer than 3 months!</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                Throughout college and past tech internships you may have had, you likely have never worked in the
                same body of code for longer than 3 months. In the process of writing said code, you likely cut a few
                corners and used a few hacky workarounds to make something work for the sake of wrapping up a project.

                Once you start working full-time, however, you're going to have to live with the consequences of these
                kinds of shortcuts. When you take shortcuts to save yourself a few days of work, your best case scenario
                is that you have to solve the problem later on. Your worst case scenario is you establish a pattern in
                your codebase that other team members will then take to heart, and then a large section of logic may
                become built on a flimsy foundation. It's almost always better to do it right the first time, rather
                than punting responsibilities for later.

                You will spend more time with your coworkers in an average week than most of your college friends. The
                value you gain from getting to know them is immense not only on a personal level, but also on a career
                level. These people can help mentor you about technical issues and design patterns, but also about the 
                mistakes they've made in their careers, and how to navigate your own career best.

                Don't be afraid to extend these sorts of meet-ups outside of your team! I have met with the CEO and
                an engineering VP multiple times just to catch up on each other's lives, give mutual feedback, and
                discuss careers. Getting to know lots of different perspectives throughout the corporate ladder can
                only help your understanding of your company and career.
